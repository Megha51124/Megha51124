👩‍💻 About Me<br><br>🔭 Hi there! I’m a Computer Science Engineering student who enjoys building real-world, end-to-end web applications and turning ideas into clean, functional products.

🔭 Currently working on
Designing and developing full-stack web applications with a strong focus on scalable backend logic, authentication flows, database-driven features, and polished UI/UX.
Most recently built StayScape, a travel accommodation platform inspired by Airbnb.

🧠 What I enjoy building
<br>
-Projects that go beyond CRUD and feel “real”
<br>
-Features like authentication, wishlists, validations, and user flows
<br>
-Clean backend architecture paired with intuitive UI

🤝🏻 Open to collaborating on
Full-stack or backend-heavy projects where I can contribute to feature development, system design, or improving existing functionality.

🌱 Currently learning & improving
<br>
-Backend architecture & best practices.
<br>
-Writing cleaner, more maintainable code.
<br>
-Performance optimization and production-readiness.

💬 Ask me about
Building full-stack projects from scratch, backend workflows, authentication logic, database design, or debugging things that “should work but don’t”. 😄

⚡ Fun facts
<br>
-I enjoy refining a project multiple times until it feels production-ready.
<br>
-I like debugging more than writing fresh code (yes, really).
<br>
-I often analyze websites for user experience and UI patterns, noticing how small design choices shape usability and flow.
<br>
-I love exploring different products to understand how teams translate ideas into intuitive interfaces.
